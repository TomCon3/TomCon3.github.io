Hello, I am Tommy Connor and I am 21 years old from Baltimore, Maryland.  I decided to learn Software Engineering because I have always been an excellent problem solver, and it could open a lot of job opportunities for me. I really wanted to do something that I would'nt get frusturated doing. I could sit on my computer all day and not even really notice it. I like puzzles and games, and finding the right code to form an action feels almost like a gamer to me. Its very rewarding when I complete a lab, almost like I have just won a game. If I can continue to enjoy coding I'm very confidate I can go very far with it.
